# leetcode-java-tdd-practice
just a storage repository for my leetcode Java TDD practice.
So far, completed:
- FizzBuzz
- Difference between two times. (IE, given string "8:30am-6:00pm", how many minutes are between the two times?)
- Two Sum (given an array of numbers and a target sum value, return a num array with the indices of the two arrayNum values that would sum to the target)
